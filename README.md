# EDGE_Detection_FPGA
Edge detection aims at finding points in a Monochrome Image (352x288) as specified, at which image intensity changes sharply or has discontinuities. The points at which image intensity changes sharply are usually organized into a set
of curved line segments called Edges. A hardware accelerator for the Edge Detector algorithm has been implemented through an ASIC design implementation. This project aims to evaluate the performance of the hardware accelerator used in the ASIC design for the Edge Detector
algorithm by implementing it on an FPGA. The simulated results of this testing will be compared to the results of an external Logic Analyzer.
